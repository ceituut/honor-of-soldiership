## Project Idea
When I was not familiar with 3D games and 3D modeling , I decided to make a 3D game character in 2D world ! In result I made a 2D soldier character that can turn with mouse. If you interested in the idea , contribute !
I still eager to work on turning 2D sprites like 3D. But now it would be time saving to use 3D assets.

## Contributing
Any contributions are welcome. Take a look at ![Contributing guideline](https://github.com/amirihusayn/HonorOfSoldiership/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## About art and animations
Consider that I'm not artist but I also made all art and animations of this game using Moho(Anime Studio). Now we need contribution on art section. The art of game isn't good enough and A lot of big size sprites has made high memory usage problem.

## To Do
For artists who interested in this project, we need 16*16 pixel arts for sprite and animations :  
- [ ] Make soldier character concept art
- [ ] Make soldier head turning sprites
- [ ] Make soldier body turning sprites
- [ ] Make soldier legs turning sprites
- [ ] Make run and walk animations
- [ ] Make enviornment sprites
