Unity version : + 2018.2.7 

## Project Idea
When I was not familiar with 3D games and 3D modeling , I decided to make a 3D game character in 2D world ! In result I made a 2D soldier character that can turn with mouse. If you interested in the idea , contribute !
I still eager to work on turning 2D sprites like 3D. But now it would be time saving to use 3D assets.

## Contributing
Any contributions are welcome.

## About art and animations
I understand that art of game isn't good enough. Consider that I'm not artist but I also made all art and animations of this game using Moho(Anime Studio). You also can contribute on art section.

## Thanks
  Unlimited thanks to God
